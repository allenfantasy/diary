<p>Quoting from <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/faq/misc.html#bikeshed-painting">Bikeshedding - FreeBSD FAQ</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why should I care what color the bikeshed is?</p>
<p>The really, really short answer is that you should not. The somewhat longer answer is that just because you are capable of building a bikeshed does not mean you should stop others from building one just because you do not like the color they plan to paint it. This is a metaphor indicating that you need not argue about every little feature just because you know enough to do so...</p>
<p>Parkinson[1] shows how you can go into the board of directors and get approval for building a multi-million or even billion dollar atomic power plant, but if you want to build a bike shed you will be tangled up in endless discussions.</p>
